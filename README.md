# SevenSegment

a logical reproduction in elixir of the following project in vhdl:
  https://github.com/GuSilverFlame/seven-segment-decoder

obs: this is no substitute to a vhdl program and won't work with any FPGA, just a logical replica of its behavior made with the intent to learn more about elixir

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `seven_segment` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
